    <h1>TÃ­tulo</h1>
    <p>An old cowboy went riding out
        One dark and windy day
        Upon a ridge he rested
        As he went along his way
        When all at once a mighty herd
        Of red eyed cows he saw
        Plowin' through the ragged skies
        And up the cloudy draw
        Their brands were still on fire
        And their hooves were made of steel
        Their horns were black and shiny
        And their hot breath he could feel
        A bolt of fear went through him
        As they thundered through the sky
        For he saw the riders coming hard
        And he heard their mournful cry
        Yippie-yi-o
        Yippie-yi-yay
        Ghost riders in the sky</p>
